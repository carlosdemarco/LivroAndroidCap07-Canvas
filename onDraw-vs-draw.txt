View

public void draw(Canvas canvas)
Manually render this view (and all of its children) to the given Canvas. 
The view must have already done a full layout before this function is called. 
When implementing a view, do not override this method; 
instead, you should implement onDraw(Canvas).  

protected void onDraw(Canvas canvas)
Implement this to do your drawing.
